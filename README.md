# HL7 Encoded String Exercise
Create a class that forms an HL7-encoded string. The class should have a method called “parse” that takes in the necessary parameters required in the PID and the PVI sections of the segment, i.e name, DOB, gender, address, doctor, etc, and return an HL7-encoded string with that data.
