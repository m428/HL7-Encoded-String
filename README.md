# HL7 Encoded String Exercise
Create a class that forms an HL7-encoded string. The class should have a method, called “parse,” that take in the necessary parameters required in the PID and the PVI section of the segment, i.e name, DOB, gender, address, doctor, etc, and return an HL7-encoded string with that data.
